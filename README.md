Make your routes do this ->![dodging](http://forgifs.com/gallery/d/80400-8/Muhammad-Ali-dodges-punches.gif)

## Why?
- makes hard-working routes super-fast, under heavy-load, [see Load Tests](loadtests)
- easy to use and fork for your needs
- works with gzip compression

## Install
```sh
npm install route-cache
```

## Test
```sh
npm test
```

## How to use
```javascript
var routeCache = require('route-cache');

// cache route for 20 seconds
app.get('/index', routeCache.cacheSeconds(20), function(req, res){
  // do your dirty work here...
  console.log('you will only see this every 20 seconds.');
  res.send('this response will be cached');
});
```

By default `req.originalUrl` is used as the cache key so every URL is cached separately.

You can set a custom key by passing a second argument to `cacheSeconds`.

```javascript
routeCache.cacheSeconds(20, 'my-custom-cache-key')
```

You can set a dynamic key from the `req` and `res` objects by passing a function.

```javascript
// Cache authenticated and unauthenticated responses separately
routeCache.cacheSeconds(20, function(req, res) {
  return req.originalUrl + '|' + res.locals.signedIn
})
```

If you return `false` the response will not be cached.

```javascript
// Only cache unauthenticated responses
routeCache.cacheSeconds(20, function(req, res) {
  if (res.locals.signedIn) { return false }

  return req.originalUrl
})
```

## Delete a cached route
```javascript
routeCache.removeCache('/index');
```

## Future plans / todos
- client-side Cache-Control
- support for distributed caches (redis or memcache)
