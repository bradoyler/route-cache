Make your routes do this ->![dodging](http://forgifs.com/gallery/d/80400-8/Muhammad-Ali-dodges-punches.gif)

## Why?
- makes hard-working routes super-fast, under heavy-load
- easy to use and fork for your needs
- works with gzip compression

## Install
```sh
npm install route-cache
```

## Test
```sh
npm test
```

## How to use
```javascript

var routeCache = require('route-cache');

// cache route for 20 seconds
app.get('/index', routeCache.cacheSeconds(20), function(req, res){
	// do your dirty work here...
	console.log('you will only see this every 20 seconds.');
	res.send('this response will be cached');
});


```

## Delete a cached route
```javascript
routeCache.removeCache('/index');
```

Each Route with get params, must be cleared seperately or you can delete the whole caches

## Delete all cached routes
```javascript
var routeCache = require('route-cache');
routeCache.cacheStore.clear();
```

## get informations about cache

```javascript
var routeCache = require('route-cache');

// max sum of cached routes
routeCache.cacheStore.maxSize,
// how much caches was served
routeCache.cacheStore.hits(),
// how much hits wihtout route cache served 
routeCache.cacheStore.misses(),
// how much cached routes are valid
routeCache.cacheStore.currentSize()
```


## Future plans / todos
- client-side Cache-Control
- support for distributed caches (redis or memcache)
